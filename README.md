## Technologies
* HTML — layout structure
* CSS — space‑themed UI styling
* JavaScript — game logic, scoring, and timing
* LocalStorage — saved best score

## Features
* Auto‑generated math questions
* Difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard)
* 30‑second rounds with a progress bar
* Score, streak, and best‑score tracking
* Recent attempts history

## How It Works

2. Solve the question before the timer runs out.
3. Submit your answer to earn points and build a streak.
4. Best score is saved locally.
